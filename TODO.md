Player HUD
- make it a prefab
- show wallet
- show in-game clock (need to build in-game clock)
- only show wallet and clock when extended (separate button / hover space)
- collapse UI when click away / stop hovering
Look into generalizing inventory UI
Need to create / add actual art

Do we want to weight the score for various interactions? For example, should
sorting shelves be more valuable than sorting aisles?
